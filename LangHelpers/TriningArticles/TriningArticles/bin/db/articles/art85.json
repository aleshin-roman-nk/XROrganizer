We translate these sentences into Turkish as \\ldblquote Benim (bir) \\'e7antam var\\rdblquote , literally \\ldblquote There is my bag\\rdblquote  (note: please don\\rquote t suggest such sentences as alternatives :D). There is also a verb, sahip olmak, so the alternative is \\ldblquote Ben (bir) \\'e7antaya sahibim.\\rdblquote  but it is less common.\\par\r\n\\par\r\nWhen you say \\ldblquote I have the bag\\rdblquote , you are certainly not giving any information about possession, this sentence only tells us about the location, that it is you who currently have the bag, maybe it is mine, but I left in your car, with you. Therefore, Turkish uses locative for this. So, \\ldblquote I have the bag\\rdblquote  will be translated as \\ldblquote\\'c7anta bende\\rdblquote . Similarly, \"I have your bag\" is \"\\'c7antan bende\"\\par\r\n\\par\r\nWhat about possession of a specific object? There are different ways to tell it in English:\\par\r\n\\par\r\nI own the bag. (\\'c7antaya ben sahibim \\f1\\endash\\ldblquote ben\\rdblquote  is not really optional here/\\f0\\'c7anta bana ait)\\par\r\nI possess the bag. (\\'c7antaya ben sahibim \\f1\\endash\\ldblquote ben\\rdblquote  is not really optional here/\\f0\\'c7anta bana ait)\\par\r\nThe bag is mine. (\\'c7anta benim/\\'c7anta benimki)\\par\r\nThe bag belongs to me. (\\'c7anta bana ait)\\par\r\nI hope it is clear for you all.
